# Cloudera Machine Learning MLOps Hands On Lab

## Summary

Cloudera Machine Learning is Cloudera’s cloud-native machine learning platform built for CDP. Cloudera Machine Learning unifies self-service data science and data engineering in a single, portable service as part of an enterprise data cloud for multi-function analytics on data anywhere.

It empowers organizations to build and deploy machine learning and AI capabilities for business at scale, efficiently and securely, anywhere they want. It’s built for the agility and power of cloud computing, but isn’t limited to any one cloud provider or data source.

MLOps is a set of practices and tools used by data scientists and engineers with the overall objective of supporting, streamlining, and improving Machine Learning Development and Production pipelines. Organizations that follow and implement ML Ops best practices are able to move more and better models to productions, ultimately increasing Data Science ROI and leading Digital Transformation across the enterprise.

### Project Overview:

This Hands On Lab guides you through the implementation of an ML Ops pipeline in CML. Your Cloudera HOL lead will send you a step by step guide with detailed end to end instructions. In summary, the HOL will consist of the following high level sections.

#### 1. Building a Model with CML

Starting from the very beginning, this exercise will walk you through a manual model implementation. First, you will prototype a baseline ML Model. Then, you will move it to production in both a Database Scoring and a REST Endpoint fashion.

#### 2. Automating Model Deployments in CML

In this exercise you will gain practical experience with the cornerstone tools of ML Ops in CML. First, you will streamline your model development with ML Flow Experiments. Then, using CML APIv2 you will automate your Production deployments.

#### 3. Scaling MLOps Pipelines

Finally, you will scale your pipeline to continuously develop, deploy and monitor multiple production models. You will simulate a critical failure, reproduce and redeploy your model in Production. In the process, you will use SDX to implement ML Governance and Compliance on both your models and users.
